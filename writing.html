                - As a capstone for my Urban Studies major at the University of Pennsylvania, I conducted primary research and wrote a senior thesis on the relationship between the University of Pennsylvania and the city of Philadelphia.
                Relations between urban universities and their surrounding communities, referred to as town-gown, have historically been strained. Conflicts have centered on use of space, encroaching student populations, land taxes, and priorities of each constituent.
                The relationship between the University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia is exemplary of these tensions, as its history is riddled with conflict.
                In the 1990s, a group called the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia (PILCOP) filed a lawsuit against Penn, accusing the university of failing to provide an adequate number of scholarships under its Mayor’s Scholarship program.
                City residents, student groups, and even City Councilors rallied against Penn alongside the lawsuit, and a prolonged struggle played out between the two sides, bringing intense publicity and polarizing town and gown.
                The Mayor’s Scholarship controversy fits cleanly into larger narratives of town-gown tensions, which can help explain why this legal question rose to such importance in the public eye.
                This paper reviews literature on town and gown, primary source publications from the time of the lawsuit, and key interviews to understand how the controversy fits into broader narratives.
                Additionally, it traces lasting impacts of the lawsuit on financial aid and models of community partnership at Penn. Lastly, it investigates the lasting significance of the controversy to the relationship between Penn and Philadelphia and town-gown more generally.

                - As a capstone for my semester abroad with the School of International Training's <i>"International Honors Program: Cities in the 21st Century,"</i> I conducted comparative ethnographic research to consider musical street performance, also known as busking, and its reciprocal relationship with tourism in
                Sao Paulo, Brazil; Cape Town, South Africa; and Hanoi, Vietnam. My first order research question asks about location and content of performance. My higher order question analyzes variation between performances, and the meaning of this variation. First, I show how buskers locate in areas of tourism,
                and how performance content varies across these three contexts. Next, I analyze how each city has a distinctive type of tourism, and apply John Urry’s notion of the “Tourist Gaze” in order to understand the relationship between tourists, buskers, and “authenticity.” This relationship has broader implications for cities, in that it reflects larger urban trends and changes.
                My research methods include photography and videography, locational mapping, first-hand observation, interviews, and consultation of relevant literature.</p>
