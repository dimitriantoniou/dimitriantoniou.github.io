            <p>I'm a 29 year old Boston native living in Texas. Both my parents were entrepreneurs, so I grew up with their ventures as my older siblings and their work as my early education.
                Ever since, I've been excited by the pace, impact, and opportunity of entrepreneurship.
                In college, I pursued a degree in Urban Studies, cultivating a set of values and lenses I now use to understand and engage with the world around me.
                These two halves of myself met when I joined the Venture for America fellowship to spend 2 years living in an emerging US economy working for a startup.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first company was Codeup, a TX based career accelerator. Beginning as the 10th team member of a ~1.5M company, the next few years sharpened my skills as a fixer and a builder.
                I joined the company as the Operations Manager. At the time, we taught 5-6 classes per year of full-stack web development.
                After managing our admissions pipeline and day to day operations, I took on the challenge of building our second product offering.
                A year later, we launched the first class of our immersive Data Science accelerator, a million dollar product that increased company revenue by 30% in the first year.
                Before this product launched, I moved into a new role as the Director of Delivery/Campus Director for our San Antonio campus to lead the program development and delivery.
                A year later, I moved to Dallas to spearhead a geographic expansion into our second campus location while leading program delivery across both cities and programs.
                A year after that, I led the merger of our Delivery and Placement departments into one operational team focused on the entire customer journey.
                Ever since, I have worked as the VP of Strategic Initiatives to accelerate our 3-year vision and execute our 1-year plan. I've led an acquisition, new product development, internal tool audits, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through many ups and downs, failures and wins, and new mountains climbed, I've found a happy place and unique ability in fixing problems during emergencies and leading adventures building things.
            </p>
