        <p>I'm a 27 year old Boston native living in Dallas, TX. Both my parents were entrepreneurs, so I gerw up with their ventures as my older siblings and their work as my early education.
            Ever since, I've been excited by the pace, impact, and opportunity of entrepreneurship.
            In college, I pursued a degree in Urban Studies, cultivating a set of values and lenses I now use to understand and engage with the world around me.
            These two halves of myself met when I joined the Venture for America fellowship to spend 2 years living in an emerging US economy working for a startup.
