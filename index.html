            <p>I'm a 27 year old Boston native living in Dallas, TX. Both my parents were entrepreneurs, so I gerw up with their ventures as my older siblings and their work as my early education.
                Ever since, I've been excited by the pace, impact, and opportunity of entrepreneurship.
                In college, I pursued a degree in Urban Studies, cultivating a set of values and lenses I now use to understand and engage with the world around me.
                These two halves of myself met when I joined the Venture for America fellowship to spend 2 years living in an emerging US economy working for a startup.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the last 4.5 years, I have worked at a TX-based career accelerator called Codeup, which helps career transitioners land and earn jobs in software development and data science.
                When I joined, we were a team of 10, and I handled all basic operations and sales. With that base of experience, I then became a builder and a fixer, spearheading projects like
                the launch of a Data Science program, the scaling of a program delivery team, the turnaround of our compliance department, a geographic expansion to Dallas, and most recently
                a resconstruction of our business development and placement department.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also had a few forays into my own endeavors, including partnering in the founding of a mindful meditation cushion and assisting with the launch of a Southeast Asian style street food restaurant.
                All of these experiences have cultivated my primary professional mission: to build sustainable business solutions that solve pressing socioeconomic issues.

                    <h2>Writing</h2>
                    <p>I didn't consider myself a writer until I graduated college and realized how much I relied on and enjoyed that skill.
                        Now, I write as a hobby, as well as in my work. Check out my portfolio of academic, professional, and personal writing.</p>

                    <h2>Code</h2>
                    <p>Working at a coding bootcamp exposed me to incredible technologies, but more importantly to the possibility that anyone can learn to code.
                    Diving in myself re-ignited my love of learning and has sparked a new passion for programming that I cultivate early in the mornings before work.</p>

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>Music has been a life-long passion since I picked up the sax in 4th grade. I used to perform weekly and tour nationally in college, but more recently have settled in as a hobby musician.
                    While Tenor Saxophone is my first love, you can now find me happily fiddling on acoustic or electric guitar, keyboard, and sometimes ukulele.</p>
